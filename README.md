I use this repositiory as an template for some C projects.

basic vscode project to create a c library with **clang**

With lib, bin and test folder and some helper scripts.

Mostly based on the very good [video](https://youtu.be/F6_WdnzQIQ4) introduction of [Travis Vroman](https://www.youtube.com/@TravisVroman).
And the wonderfull [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8Ddw9K0JPg1BEO-RS-0MYs423cvLVtj).

Features Powershell, Command Prompt and Bash Scripts to build the library.
